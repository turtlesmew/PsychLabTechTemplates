# Psychology Computer Lab Tech Templates
Included in this github are two templates in C#.NET. These templates are to assist in creating simple psychology based data acquisition programs. Both templates showcase different styles of experiment as well as ways of programming them.

PsychTemplate *(WinForms)* features one simple experiment that shows images and allows user input at the end. Inside the code, there is also an variation to the experiment that plays audio. This experiment has a skeleton to export data as a csv file and email the results.

PsychTemplateWPF *(WPF)* features two smaller experiments: image selection and a math quiz. Once closing the window, the user will be prompted to save an excel file. This version has a more modern look and should be easier to start from regardless of the type of experiment.
